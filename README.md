# altium

## Generate file
To generate the file you should run the command altiumHost.exe generate 3000000000
where 3000000000 - approximate number of bytes in the target file.

The result is the file with name "result.txt".

## Sorting the file

To sort the file you should run the command altiumHost.exe sort result.txt
where result.txt is the unsorted file.

The result is the file with name "out.txt"

## Comment

The implementation is quite naive and suboptimal
